 # 🐘 Big Data Hands-On Project – Hadoop, Pig, Hive, MapReduce

This repository contains my practical work completed during the **2nd semester of M.Sc. Computer Science (Honours)** with a **specialization in Data Science**. Under the mentorship of **Dr. R.K. Singla** and **Prof. Vishali**, I explored various tools and technologies within the Big Data ecosystem.

## 📘 Project Overview

This project covers foundational and applied aspects of Big Data including:

- **Introduction to Big Data & Hadoop Ecosystem**
- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**
- **MapReduce programming**
- **Apache Pig scripting**
- **Apache Hive querying**
- **Environment setup on Windows and Linux**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Apache Hadoop
- Cloudera Quickstart VM
- Apache Pig
- Apache Hive
- Windows 11
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- VirtualBox / VMware

## 📂 Contents

### 1. 🔧 Environment Setup
- Installation of Apache Hadoop on Windows 11
- Setup of Cloudera Quickstart Virtual Machine
- Creating shared folders between Windows and Linux

### 2. 🧮 MapReduce Programs
- Word Count
- Matrix Multiplication

### 3. 🐷 Apache Pig
- Word Count using Pig
- Analysis of:
  - Drivers & Timesheet Dataset
  - Movies Dataset
  - IPL Dataset
  - Employee Dataset

### 4. 🐝 Apache Hive
- Word Count using Hive
- HiveQL queries for:
  - Employee Data
  - IPL Data
  - Online Social Network Data

## 📚 What I Learned
